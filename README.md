# Programming2Project(WelTec)
Developed through Visual Studio 2019 Windows Form

# Working as expected though there are some limitations as follows.
- Category for search is there but not really used for anything. It was supposed to be a DropDown list to narrow search.
- Validation took a lot of time to do than expected so only made one for the Item Edit Changes, but it is currently one step behind before it validates.
- Penalty calculation wasn't applied

# Other than that everything works as it should.
# Instructions
- When adding a new item, user must look for that item in the listbox then add more details of that item and save.
- User Management Button displays a list of users and view their details and borrowings. 
 *Where issued items can be recieve by the admin and take it off the list.*

# Other features applied as an exenstion of Assignment 1.
- Read and Write to files
- Edit and Save changes to files
- Recieve items and taken off the users issued list
- Hides other details if not needed and so it shows minimalistic.
